//! A stream that efficiently multiplexes multiple streams.
//!
//! This "combinator" provides the ability to maintain and drive a set of streams to completion,
//! while also providing access to each stream as it yields new elements.
//!
//! Streams are inserted into this set and their realized values are yielded as they are produced.
//! This structure is optimized to manage a large number of streams. Streams managed by
//! `StreamUnordered` will only be polled when they generate notifications. This reduces the
//! required amount of work needed to coordinate large numbers of streams.
//!
//! When a `StreamUnordered` is first created, it does not contain any streams. Calling `poll` in
//! this state will result in `Poll::Ready((None)` to be returned. Streams are submitted to the
//! set using `insert`; however, the stream will **not** be polled at this point. `StreamUnordered`
//! will only poll managed streams when `StreamUnordered::poll` is called. As such, it is important
//! to call `poll` after inserting new streams.
//!
//! If `StreamUnordered::poll` returns `Poll::Ready(None)` this means that the set is
//! currently not managing any streams. A stream may be submitted to the set at a later time. At
//! that point, a call to `StreamUnordered::poll` will either return the stream's resolved value
//! **or** `Poll::Pending` if the stream has not yet completed.
//!
//! Whenever a value is yielded, the yielding stream's index is also included. A reference to the
//! stream that originated the value is obtained by using [`StreamUnordered::get`],
//! [`StreamUnordered::get_mut`], or [`StreamUnordered::get_pin_mut`].
//!
//! In normal operation, `poll` will yield a `StreamYield::Item` when it completes successfully.
//! This value indicates that an underlying stream (the one indicated by the included index)
//! produced an item. If an underlying stream yields `Poll::Ready(None)` to indicate termination,
//! a `StreamYield::Finished` is returned instead. Note that as soon as a stream returns
//! `StreamYield::Finished`, its token may be reused for new streams that are added.

// StreamUnordered is implemented using two linked lists. One which links all
// streams managed by a `StreamUnordered` and one that tracks streams that have
// been scheduled for polling. The first linked list allows for thread safe
// insertion of nodes at the head as well as forward iteration, but is otherwise
// not thread safe and is only accessed by the thread that owns the
// `StreamUnordered` value for any other operations. The second linked list is
// an implementation of the intrusive MPSC queue algorithm described by
// 1024cores.net.
//
// When a stream is submitted to the set, a task is allocated and inserted in
// both linked lists. The next call to `poll_next` will (eventually) see this
// task and call `poll` on the stream.
//
// Before a managed stream is polled, the current context's waker is replaced
// with one that is aware of the specific stream being run. This ensures that
// wake-up notifications generated by that specific stream are visible to
// `StreamUnordered`. When a wake-up notification is received, the task is
// inserted into the ready to run queue, so that its stream can be polled later.
//
// Each task is wrapped in an `Arc` and thereby atomically reference counted.
// Also, each task contains an `AtomicBool` which acts as a flag that indicates
// whether the task is currently inserted in the atomic queue. When a wake-up
// notifiaction is received, the task will only be inserted into the ready to
// run queue if it isn't inserted already.
